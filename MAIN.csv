"Hired a Chief Diversity Officer.
Created the DEIB certificate.
Adding diversity to leadership groups and committees.
Being more transparent in their policies and procedures.",1
"Stop with the bigoted DEI focus.  Fire the racist and sexist organization ''The Diversity Movement"" and go back to recognizing people as individuals.  All we are doing now is being a racist and sexist organization who is only concerned about race and sex.  

Diversity of thought is important-- but we stopped caring about that the moment we embraced the racist DEI ideology. ",2
Chief Hinson is doing a very poor job -- needs to be dismissed.,3
"Not much. It is, and always will be, a ""country club.""",4
It should not be doing anything.  The AAA should be only a professional organization of academic accounts devoted to teaching and research about accounting.  Diversity has nothing whatsoever to do with this mission.,5
Long-term and ongoing commitment (rather than simply reacting to current events and then forgetting about DEI),6
Too much,7
"I like that the AAA is attempting to address issues of inclusion and equity. In order for people to be willing to select into a profession, they need to have visible role models. ",8
"AAA journals. Need at least 2-3 DEI special issues for each journal. Having only one is not enough, like IAE and AH. This will also help readers and reviewers accustomed to reading DEI articles. The special issues have shown that there is a supply of articles but limited opportunities in accounting journals. ",9
"DEIB training made accessible to all.
",10
DEIB workshops and certificates; monthly spotlights of different marginalized groups,11
I think the leadership ranks are better reflecting the diversity among our membership. ,12
"You're taking it TOO FAR! Think about your members - are you genuinely concerned that WE need help understanding how to treat people? We're not stupid - we know that all your DEI stuff is either virtue signaling, organizational risk management, or some combination. Maybe ease up on all this and lower our dues??",13
Nothing. This survey is just one example. The AAA has now become more biased Than ever despite now being more diverse than ever. Focus on accounting. Also where is the disclosure to subjects for this survey. It is being conducted by an organization with academic ties. The question choices are rather questionable in a sense that you will not get a true picture of what you are trying to gauge. Yet another waste of money and time thanks to this mismanaged organization. ,14
"My section (ATA) has always felt welcoming to a diverse set of faculty. We have a number of women and LGBTQ+ members who hold or have held leadership positions. We have fewer members of color in general and so have/have had fewer members of color in leadership positions. However, our Ph.D. student and newer faculty cohorts include more members of color so hopefully we see some of them in leadership positions in the future.",15
Yes,16
Examining the issues and getting feedback from members---AAA is actually taking constructive action to address the issue,17
"Lots of good programs, speakers - clearly a major concern.",18
Nothing.  This is all just democrat propaganda.,19
Lately the topic has been front and center in the communications sent to members. I think that talking about the topic is a good thing.,20
Diversity section; DEIB training; emphasis at conferences,21
The AAA has done more than enough to support and encourage diversity. There is no need to go overboard.,22
"Being proactive in seeking to reflect our larger society.  This is coming at a cost though.  I strongly feel that policies put in place in recent years are stifling the free flow of ideas unacceptably.  This may seem like an odd concern for accounting professors.  However, some of us advocate for economic systems that frankly could land us with the AAA thought police because one person disagrees.  NOT GOOD!  ",23
I don't know.,24
This question is written in an extremely biased manner. Important and very important are not even options. This is a forced choice question which I believe to be unethical.,25
"AAA should be focused on matters that facilitate academic and research excellence, avoiding distractions that want to complete with this important mission or else AAA will lose prominence.",26
Don't forget what the AAA actual purpose is.,27
The AAA is spending too much time and effort on diversity.  ,28
My suspicion is that 80% of the AAA membership is indifferent to DEIB but is too afraid to state this for fear of retribution,29
"Interpretation of the questions is problematic. My answers could be interpreted that there is a problem and biasing against DEI individuals, but it is the opposite. White, conservative, and religious individuals are discriminated against in the AAA. So be very careful in how you interpret the results. ",30
"A better question is: how important should diversity be to AAA. AAA is an open, fair and equitable organization with room for all - in the regard, it has been making important progress since the 1990s and continues now.

Given this background (emphasis added) as an organization, AAA should continue itâ€™s diversity efforts BUT BUT BUT AAA has far more pressing problems: declining student enrollments, declining membership, a transition to a Zoom world where communications are not dependent on AAA meetings, an internet based world where members are not dependent on AAA for resources. 

In light of all this, what is AAAâ€™s value proposition??? Itâ€™s not diversityâ€¦ The AAA needs to expand internationally, but can only do that IF IF IF it understands itâ€™s value proposition - at this point in time, AAA does not understand its value proposition; itâ€™s not alone, neither does the accounting profession. 

While diverse is important, it feels like itâ€™s priority #1 for AAA and AAA has far bigger problems that will not be addressed no matter how many resources are devoted to diversity.",31
"To paraphrase George Carlin, DEI ""is America's newest form of intolerance, and it is especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance. It presents itself as fairness, yet attempts to restrict and control people's language with strict codes and rigid rules. I'm not sure that's the way to fight discrimination. I'm not sure silencing people or forcing them to alter their speech is the best method for solving problems that go much deeper than speech.â€

The AAA needs to stand firm against DEI.  ",32
"Too much emphasis on DEI now.  More like a fad.  I mean, where did this come from? And why is it so urgent NOW?  Accounting has more urgent problems now, declining enrollments, and general demand for accounting.  DEI sounds good but is mostly a distraction.  ",33
I think the AAA has done a good job finding diverse employees and leaders. It also ensures speakers and presenters at conferences and webinars are diverse (along a variety of dimensions) and ensures all people feel welcome. ,34
stop wasting time with this fake issue; channel your energy into something more productive! ,35
Diversity of thought is more important than racial Diversity ,36
AAA has already made very great initiatives to address the DEI as demonstrated by hiring the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer as well as having elected its first African American as its current president.,37
"don't know, I do not pay much attention to it",38
"[Why no question on what AAA is NOT doing well?] The AAA has certainly gone 1,000 MPH on the DEI issue over the past 2 years, with virtually every AAA email communication leading with a robust DEI section. Likewise, the Annual Meeting was very heavy on DEI and ESG. However, my sense is that more conservative AAA members are just keeping their heads down (reflected in some of my earlier answers) and are struggling to understand the notion of equity versus equal opportunity. Like much of academia, the AAA certainly has the feel of going woke in a huge way. In the quest for racial and gender diversity, I hope that the AAA will not squelch viewpoint diversity or success through merit. Ultimately, AAA is an accounting organization, not a DEI organization (I think),",39
"Diverse for who? Seems like certain groups get all the attention but others, like Asians, are ignored. ",40
The online diversity discussions are helpful. More helpful would be funding to draw more diverse individuals to careers teaching accounting.,41
Awareness is a critical first step and the AAA has done well with that phase. Real and meaningful action with oversight and repercussions for bad actors is whatâ€™s missing. ,42
"Nothing.  DEI as you define it is neo-racism, extraordinarily divisive, a fabulous waste of resources, and an obsession which is replacing scholars with ideologues.  Your goal, it appears to many of us, is to have AAA bureaucrats allocate resources by ever-stranger categories of grievance.   You are headed for a tinier organization which is avoided by the real scholars in the accounting academy.  I for one am not renewing my membership for next year, as I donâ€™t want to continue funding the ugly little tyrannies of your political activism.",43
I do not know. ,44
"being open-mind, tolerance, education, competence, sustainability",45
No ideology in academia please. I am afraid the AAA turned woke.,46
Being aware of the issue and taking all the necessary step to guarantee full inclusion of any member,47
I have not done the training yet but heard it was excellent.  I hear a lot about it but not sure what accomplishments have been made.  How far has the organization come.  What is the roadmap ahead?,48
"DEIB training course, DEIB book club, DEIB history education, celebrating heritage months, WeARe webinars on DEIB, partnership with NABA, PHd candidate programs for minorities.",49
Building the DEIB Certificate and the DEI Board position and task force.,50
"PRO: The AAA has increased the visibility of nonwhite faces on its websites and in its activities. 

BUT IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ASK WHAT IS NOT WORKING; FAILURE TO ASK AN OPEN-ENDED QUESTION ON THIS IS INDICATIVE OF THE PROBLEM. 

WHERE WE COULD DO BETTER: The new push toward publishing shorter papers after a mentoring/registered intent process works to allow editors of special editions to hand pick whomever they like and save spaces for their best buddies. It may also reward those who work in 'popular/faddish' areas in a manner that could exacerbate the lack of ideological diversity that has been recognized as a particular problem in accounting research.  AAA journals allow prominent scholars to opine on the status of the profession but are notoriously stingy with space for critical commentary from a heterodox point of view. Forcing every paper into a tired template: What small, narrow problem does the paper address/literature review/statement of hypotheses/data analysis/conclusion is clearly driven by managing the search engine metrics.  This approach promotes citations of prior literature; it precludes innovative ways of looking at systemic problems that are not amenable to tired tropes of Aristolean 'normal' science logic.   

Participation by undergraduate and masters level students is difficult under the fee structure; to attract future scholars, undergraduate and masters level students should be able to be a member for free and attend regional conferences at a very nominal rate.  

Rolling the regional programs into one SPARK event gives fewer opportunities for participation. Of course, the separate regions were a nightmare to manage even before COVID. On the other hand, they provided more opportunities for those who are not yet great scholars to get on board and participate without prior connections.   The AAA's elite journals are heavily finance and economics oriented.  The AAA's aspiration motto is to be a THOUGHT LEADER, but the organization does too little to actively promote interdisciplinarity that could lead to innovative thinking about opportunities for pro-active impact on society. Even members of the public interest section have been given the message that the AAA leadership is highly concerned that some faculty might become advocates rather than purveyors of neutral, objective data. Even the history section members do not realize the problem in telling new authors to just stick with the facts and do not engage in critique. Membership in the public interest and history sections are low; perhaps it is because PHD programs and the AAA in turn are too closely aligned with major public accounting firms and faculty realize that there is little to no institutional support for faculty to raise challenges to the status quo. 
The usual progression from track chair, to section chair, to national leadership is in itself likely to promote conformity of thought.  Those willing to take on mundane tasks to produce a conference program are often thought followers rather than thought leaders.  Paths to leadership on national committees needs to be revisited.   

The AAA's proactive stance on issues like STEM/CPA EVOLUTION, DATA ANALYTICS, and CRITICAL THINKING gives the impression of a very controlled and orchestrated message rather than one that would encourage thinking about both the pros and the cons of these issues.  The AICPA study on critical thinking is biased toward a step oriented progress from lower level to higher order thought; other literatures suggest that critical thinking is a holistic activity in which the concepts and facts from the lower level courses interfere with the ability to approach problems with an open, creative mindset. Education is a political process; but AAA conference agendas  and journal output seldom engage with the sociological and public interest issues that are common in elite journals outside the AAA fold. Why does the accounting profession have a diversity problem? Perhaps it is because our certification exams, assurance of learning programs, the institutional forces in our professional organizations, and even our programs that claim to promote critical thinking work function as mechanism to stifle ideological diversity.  The purpose of diversity is not so that the profession can check a few boxes, but so that the profession can benefit from the diversity of ideas that persons with different life experiences bring to the table. Accounting governance and certification structures are mechanisms of control that were built in an environment where the goal was to limit access to profession.  In the new environment the whole process of rewards and structures that limit discourse needs to be revisited with an eye toward promoting new paths to leadership and to encourage streams of thought that do more than nibble at the corners of research theories built by white males from elite PHD programs in a manner that adds to citation counts but does virtually nothing to address social, professional, or organizational problems.    

Black/brown issues in the pipeline are not the only problem; too little emphasis is being paid to the problem of how to either better mentor lower SES students into the professional culture or to explore how the profession can adapt to this group's differences in mores. Ideological and demographic diversity are arguable two sides of the same coin. The AAA functions well as an apparatus to bolster the prestige of PHD level research in finance and economics.  The leadership does not encourage the kind of lively pro and con debate that is needed to rethink 'how we have always done it'; a mindset that is critical for the sustainability of the profession.  While AAA conferences encourage dialog on pedagogical issues, the structure of the regional and annual meeting programs leave one with an impression that these are second-class activities. 

Teaching award applications should not require the applicant to sign away their rights for distribution of materials; word on the street is that some are declining to apply for this reason.  ",51
"I think the AAA is doing fine with DEI. Other forms of bias, discrimination, and harrassment that are not DEI related are the really big problem.",52
The online training curriculum,53
Setting the tone and including the topic in all communications help to show this is important from the top on down.,54
"Lots of attention being paid to DEIB, workshops, initiatives.",55
Continuing to communicate about DEI and it's importance.,56
The AAA like much of academia is recognizing the issue and initiating programs to address issues.,57
Nothing.  I have heard many comments that the recent diversity effort has inhibited the free flow of ideas.  People are afraid to criticize the research of minority presenters for fear of being labeled racist.  The minority researcher is then harmed by not having access to the ideas of individuals who could become mentors.  I have been told that people are scared; they are afraid to participate.,58
Offering educational opportunities.,59
Iâ€™m unsure.,60
"Barbee. She is amazing, and her materials are the best in the world. ",61
Can't think of anyting,62
"The DEIB continuing education program was very helpful and informative.  I also liked that it was offered in multiple versions live online and self-study and that it was free.


My concern is that the membership price is hard for non-PhD faculty to pay.  I think there could be bias against professionally qualified members vs. Ph.ds and/or fulltime tenured faculty at small liberal arts colleges that do not have the resources that research institutions may.  

",63
The AAA has done a great job of creating and communicating about DEI initiatives. The new leadership is more transparent and that goes a long way in building trust and a sense of inclusion. ,64
"The AAA is doing a good job of putting people into boxes based on race and other characteristics. I do not consider this to be a good thing. I believe diversity of thought and opinion is a good thing, but measuring diversity based on how people look is ridiculous. ",65
DEIB certificate,66
"Hiring a CDO, creating a DEI Certificate, DEI section in newsletters, DEI materials for members, etc.",67
Membership is open to all. You are not required to submit letters of reference to join.,68
"The AAA does not have any roadblocks that I am aware of to keep people of any group from doing whatever they would like to do. Moreover, I think the AAA does a good job of encouraging participation and recruitment of diverse people. But I think there are some major risks associated with an overemphasis on diversity. The more we focus on diversity, the more emphasis is placed on what makes us different, rather than on the things that unite us. I think the best way to create unity and an inclusive organization is to unite everyone behind a common goal--which should have something to do with teaching accounting. Diversity is not a meaningful end of itself.",69
Look at the racial demographics of the AAA workforce for your answer.,70
"Everything you're doing is going to backfire. You're shoving it down people's throats rather than just focusing on what your organization is supposed to do (Journals, running conferences, etc.). Why is a ""DEIB"" update the FIRST thing on ALL your emails? Have you ever heard of virtue signaling? Moral licensing? Why do you think that THIS organization, out of all organizations, has any competitive advantage or right or reason to advocate for these things?

BTW, before you do what most people do in this situation and accuse me of ""racism"" or ""prejudice,"" I myself am a minority married to another minority, who is an immigrant. So don't just handwave away my comments as if you all have some imagined superiority. ",71
Barbee's approach to programs was great!,72
"I know that there is a training program, and other measures are being taken but don't know specifics. To be honest, I tried for years to be a part of the organization but was unsuccessful and eventually gave up trying.",73
They are emphasizing it a good bit.,74
The AAA has made vocal steps to try to promote DEI and make the Association seem like a place with greater belonging through its support for its Office of DEI and the DEI course offered to colleges.,75
"Diversity is ""not very important"" because AAA is a diverse, open, welcoming organization. All persons are welcome; all persons are eligible for election to leadership. All persons are respected.

That does not mean that the AAA is free from persons who are non-welcoming. BUT - after 25 years with AAA, I can state that such persons are a very small minority.

AAA has other issues that are much more pressing and much more threatening to the organization.

Diversity efforts should continue at AAA and all organizations. We can always improve. But, at AAA, diversity is not an major problem and violations of the AAA Code of Conduct can be / should be handled as encountered.
",76
"I think they've done a lot to address sexism, xenophobia, and racism. I think less has been done to address religious discrimination, discrimination against conservatives, discrimination against topic areas, and discrimination against research methodologies. I think those are far more pervasive in accounting academia. The fact that there has been nothing to address those, particularly anything on discrimination against topic areas and discrimination against research methodologies at schools, journals, and associations is probably a grave oversight.",77

Encouraging diversity in leadership positions.   ,79
I have no idea!,80
"Talking about the issue a lot, having speakers and panels at multiple meetings, great resources available through the website",81
This is all democrat propaganda and is extremely unethical.,82
"Honestly, I can't say anything comes to mind after thinking about this. I see some superficial attempts to address DEI but I don't think anything meaningful has occurred. ",83
"The DEIB certificate program, the Diversity section, sessions on DEIB at conferences ",84
I am disappointed that AAA is jumping on this bandwagon.,85
"These responses are not appropriate. To ask how important ""diversity"" is, do you mean DEIB efforts that place undue attention on diversity issues, or actual diversity in race, gender, socioeconomic background, nationality, etc? The AAA should be an open-to-all meritocracy. To me, diversity is a good thing, but I don't know that DEIB initiatives are a good thing.",86
"The AAA wastes time with fake political issues that detract from those that matter. We are losing membership; our research is irrelevant to practice, and we follow a political agenda not based on merit. ",87
"Just released architecture certificate. Working on inclusive classroom certificate. Promotion of DEIB at annual meetings, meetings, and on website. Hiring DEIB employee.",88
Not very familiar with the efforts.,89
Simply asking the questions is the first key to unlocking the door.,90
"The DEI(B) page on the AAA website has a ton of great resources (though I'm curious why the Education menu link isn't labeled ""DEIB"" to match the rest of the organization's DEI wording.  Barbee has been wonderful, as were the DEIB certificate courses (and the certificate itself). I'm sad to hear that she is retiring, but I hope the AAA builds on the work she has done and finds another wonderful person to fill that role.",91
Lots of great sessions at conferences!,92
"1. AAA seems to have functioned quite well from 1916 up to and including now in terms of diversity.
2. I do not understand what unnumbered Question/Statement #6 on the previous page means.",93
"The AAA is catering to minorities at the expense of the majority, but not in a good way. It's more of a ""shame on you"" process than a collaborative one. ",94
The AAA is bowing at the altar of woke culture to the detriment of its actual mission.,95
I think making it known that diversity is valuable through surveys like this is a great thing.,96
"Providing conferences and training opportunities that are specifically focused on these efforts is a great help. Additionally, the AAA appears to be continuing to make efforts to make all voices heard. ",97
"In an effort to build diversity, you are not addressing the needs of your current members",98
The AAA should not be pursuing this.,99
"1. Trying!
2. Training/education (opportunities for members)
3. Financially supporting underrepresented members",100
"I am impressed with the work the AAA is doing here. The webinars, books, and other resources on DEIB are much appreciated. ",101
"Not much for ideological diversity, appear to be chasing a socialist agenda as much as possible.",102
"I like this question more than the previous one. Diversity for the sake of diversity is not that important to me, but I do place priority on equity. At the same time, I do not wish to pander to anyone. I have colleagues who feel that they are the ""token-fill-in-the-blank"" on various committees due to their backgrounds. I do not wish to create that culture either. Also, some people need similarities to feel that they belong. For example, I see no problem with a subgroup in the Association focused on women's issues or black American issues. I suppose I wouldn't see a problem with similar groups on men's issues or white's issues, but we would need to be careful, and this is the problem with equity today. Things are not equal when I hesitate to even suggest certain groups cannot meet together to talk about their issues because they might be considered bigoted. Whereas the latter two may not have faced as much bias in the past, I think there is mounting bias presently, but there remains bias to the former, putting us in an even sadder position. Are we making matters better or worse? I suppose I am good with the status quo for now, meaning focus on women's rights issues and minorities' rights issues, and just see where things go. I am not certain that I would overemphasize it, though, just emphasize it. ",103
"AAA needs to think of diversity for all minority groups not just certain groups. If you want to address diversity, it must be addressed in its totality. ",104
"The work of the Diversity section, including the DEIB Certificate, gives me hope for the organization.",105
